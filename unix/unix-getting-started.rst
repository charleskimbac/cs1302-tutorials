Introduction
============

Unix is a family of computer operating systems that derive from work performed
in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie,
and others. In this course, we use the term Unix to refer to systems that are
Unix-like; i.e., their user interface and basic set of utilities are
reminiscent of a Unix system.

In Unix, the primary end-user, command-line interface to the system is a program
called the *shell*. This program can be usually be accessed via another program
called a *terminal emulator*. In the shell, you enter *commands* at a *prompt*.
Here are some examples of what such a prompt might look like:

.. code-block:: shell

   bash$

.. code-block:: shell

   zsh%

The shell is just another way to interact with computer. These days, all
students are familiar with the point-and-click graphical windowing systems
provided in operating systems like Windows, macOS, and even phones.
However, only some realize that the windowing system they're used to is
only one way to interact with a computer. Consider the figure below.

.. figure:: img/intro1.png
   :alt: Local terminal (left) and Finder app (right) on macOS.

In the figure, two different interfaces to the same computer running the Unix-like
macOS operating system are presented. On the left, the window of a terminal
emulator (or a "terminal window," for short) is displayed containing the output
of the commands ``ls`` and ``tree`` (discussed later). On the right, the graphical
Finder app is displayed containing some of the same information. Take a moment
to convince yourself that both images are displaying roughly the same information 
in two different ways.

Prompt and Circumstance
=======================

The text that a shell displays for its prompt will differ depending
the shell program itself and a user's profile settings. Consider the
two prompts shown in the introduction. Intentionally presented, the
``bash$`` prompt is similar to what a |bash|_ shell would produce, and
the ``zsh%`` prompt is similar to what a |zsh|_ shell would produce.
In this tutorial, we will not present any features that are specific
to either of these shells; instead, we will focus on general Unix
commands using syntax that is supported by both.

.. |bash| replace:: Bash
.. _bash: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)

.. |zsh| replace:: Zsh
.. _zsh: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell

To keep things simple, we will follow a standard convention of denoting
the prompt with a single ``$`` character. Therefore, if you see a line
of text in this tutorial that begins with a single ``$`` character, then it
means that the text after the ``$`` character represents a command that
should be typed at a prompt. In such examples, the first ``$`` character
is **not** part of the command. To emphasize this, consider the following
example of the ``date`` command:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ date

When you try to execute the command on your own, do not include the
first ``$`` character in what you type or paste into your terminal emulator.  If
you forget to omit it, then your shell will interpret it as part of the
command itself. This is illustrated in the figures below.

Required Setup
==============

Before you continue, you need to make sure that your computer is setup so
that you can follow along with the tutorial. If you are using a Windows
computer or a Mac, then please follow the instructions below that best match
your computer's operating system.

* `Setup on macOS <https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-exercises/blob/master/misc/MacOS.md>`__
* `Setup on Windows 10 <https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-exercises/blob/master/misc/Windows10.md>`__
  (should also work for Windows 11)

If you are using a Linux computer or a computer running a Unix-like operating
system (other than macOS), then do not fret -- they almost always come with a
terminal emulator installed. If you are not sure how to access the terminal
emulator provided by your operating system, then please consult your operating
system's documentation.

Local Terminal
==============

When you run a terminal emulator, the usual default is for it
to connect to the same computer it is running on. This *local terminal*
provides a shell with a command-line interface to that computer. Consider the
figure below.

.. figure:: img/local-terminals.png
   :alt: iTerm 2 on macOS Big Sur (left) and MobaXterm 21.2 on Windows 10 (right)

In the figure, we see two different terminal emulators running on two different
computers: the iTerm 2 terminal emulator on the left is running on macOS
and the MobaXterm terminal emulator on the right is running on Windows. While
the commands that were entered by the user are similar in both images, the output
is different because the commands are executing on different machines.

Most, if not all, of the basic commands that we present in the tutorial
should work within a local terminal. When they do not, you should seek out
and consult the documentation for your combination of terminal emulator and
operating system.

Remote Terminal
===============

To make sure that readers all have roughly the same experience with the tutorial,
we will instruct them to use a local terminal to launch a program that will
connect their terminal emulator to a remote computer (often referred to as a
server). Once connected, that *remote terminal* provides a shell with a command-line
interface to that remote computer. Consider the figure below.

.. figure:: img/remote-terminals.png
   :alt: iTerm 2 on macOS Big Sur (left) and MobaXterm 21.2 on Windows 10 (right)
         both connected to a third, remote machine.

In the figure, we see two different terminal emulators running on two different
machines; however, both are connected to the same remote computer. Just like
you need credentials (e.g., a personal username and password) to access certain
websites or online apps, you will also need credentials to initiate a remote
terminal session. In the figure, the same user credentials were used in both
images, which means that that they are both logged in as the same user on
the remote computer. Since a terminal emulator is, itself, a program, you can
even have two terminal emulators on the same machine connected to the remote computer,
as illustrated in the figure below.

.. figure:: img/multi-user.png
   :alt: One terminal on one machine (left) and two terminals on a second machine (right)
         all connected to a remote computer (center).

Most Unix-like operating systems support multiple users and multiple sessions
per user. The tutorial will show you how to establish a remote terminal
session. After that, you are encouraged to try logging in more than once to
see what it's like.
